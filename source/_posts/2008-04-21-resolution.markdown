I know, I know, it is April now. Maybe it is too late.

My year started by receiving a nice text message that announced: "Happy new year. I know this year will be a fantastic one for us."

Well, predicting future it is not an easy job. :)
Since that text message up to now everything has changed. When saying "everything" I really mean everything. Only the job remained the same.

Therefore, I decided to make some resolutions in order to focus in which direction I am going.

Here we are:

1) Decluttering my life in every aspect.
  In the near future I'll write a post about that.
  In the meantime, have a look at my [desk](http://flickr.com/photos/39931469@N00/2233867159/) so you can barely understand how much clutter is there in my life. :)

2) Stop complaining
  Even if things are not going well I have to answer to questions like "How are you?" with "FINE!"

3) Stop wasting time with stupid activities like watching Italian television

4) Stop watching movies in bed

5) Starting a daily routine

6) Sop buying new books until I haven't finished all the books which are waiting to be read.
  I think I cannot accomplish this one :)

7) Stop chasing people.

8) Stop thinking at all :)
  I've already [posted](http://basetta.pupazzo.org/blog/2008/04/09/stop-thinking/) something about that.

9) Start to do some fitness.

10) Start learning more systematically German and English

For the time being I am on a winning streak. I hope it lasts for at least one year.
