title: Concert in Fluc Vienna
wordpress_id: 41

Yesterday, I went to [Fluc](http://www.fluc.at).  

The place is smooky - like almost all places here in Vienna -, small but
with a good atmosphere.




[Bell Etage](http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendID=161416990) gave a short concert. I'm happy to have discovered
them. They make really good music - or better, a music I like.





A friend of mine has a video, and maybe he will upload it tomorrow.





Now, I'd like to make maps with all the place I used to go here in [ Vienna](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&om=1&hl=en&z=11&ll=48.21776,16.393307&spn=0.236991,0.752563&msid=104464474868662172755.0000011209592fd5a1ac6&msa=0), and in [Austria](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?f=q&q=graz&layer=&ie=UTF8&om=1&hl=en&z=9&ll=47.068858,15.442679&spn=0.969061,3.010254&msid=104464474868662172755.0000011204711f5e64612&msa=0) in general (Thanks to [Grissino](http://grissino.blogspot.com) for the idea).
