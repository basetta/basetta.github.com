Yesterday, I took my motorcycle driving licence - at long last!!!

Now I face the problem which motorcycle to buy.

If I had already a good driving experience, I would buy for sure a
Supermotard KTM 640 LC4.

But maybe it's better I content myself with this other one .

But I'll think again about it in March. Now winter is coming and a motorcylce is not the best "vehicle" to ride.
