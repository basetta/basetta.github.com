It's been too long since I posted last.

Speaking with a friend of mine I realized that everything has already happened. I explain myself a little bit better.

Every situation is a repetition of a past situation. If you think - for example - either of a war, or of a relationship - only to take two examples with diametrical positions -, we can recognize some patterns.

The only thing changing are the actors involved and the epoch.

The sadness of all of this is that we do not learn anything from the past.

Is it demagogic?

Yes, it is but I do not care.
