Yesterday, I went to see [Gogol Bordello](http://www.gogolbordello.com) in Arena Wien.

For me it was the second time ([here](http://patrick.pupazzo.org) you can find some videos of the first concert).

I'd liked the first concert more than the second one - also because they played much longer in the first one.





Yesterday, they played only for one hour but it was really amazing.
There were three other groups as well:




  * [Bedouin Soundclash](http://www.bedouinsoundclash.com/)


  * [Disco Ensemble](http://www.discoensemble.com/news.php)


  * [Danko Jones](http://www.dankojones.com/)








I found **Bedouin Soundclash** quite interesting. The other two groups do not play my kind of music. But still I have to say they are good musicians, or I should better say, I believe they are because for sure I'm not an expert.





I might be able to play only the triangle but I'm not even sure about that.
