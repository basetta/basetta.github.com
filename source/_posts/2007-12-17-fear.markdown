title: What are we putting off out of fear?
wordpress_id: 33

Usually, what we most fear doing is what we most need to do: a
particular phone call, a meeting or whatever the action might be.  

Like **Timoty Ferris** says: this is the fear of the unknown.





Often, I postpone some activities by saying: "I don't feel like it" ("non ho
voglia" in Italian)





Yet, doing so doesn't help at all; if anything, it creates a lot of "open mind thoughts" -
that's how I call it.




Therefore, I have recently adopted a new **"technique"**: I make a list
of all the things I recognize I'm putting off. Then, I define which item/s is/are the
worst for me and I accomplish it/them immediately.





The stuff I love to do I put aside which I however accomplish when I'm tired.





The only small problem is to force myself to follow this new rule. :)





I'm lazy, you know.
