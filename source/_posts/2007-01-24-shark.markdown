A species of shark rarely seen alive because its natural habitat is **600** meters (2,000 ft) or more under the sea was captured on film by staff at a Japanese marine park this week.


The **Awashima Marine Park** in Shizuoka, south of Tokyo, was alerted by a fisherman at a nearby port on Sunday that he had spotted an odd-looking eel-like creature with a mouthful of needle-sharp teeth.



The shark appeared to be in poor condition when park staff moved it to a seawater pool where they filmed it swimming and opening its jaws.


The shark died a few hours after being caught. **Frilled sharks**, which feed on other sharks and sea creatures, are sometimes caught in the nets of trawlers but are rarely seen alive.
