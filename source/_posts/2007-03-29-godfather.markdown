Yesterday, I watched for the 7th time the Godfather part II.

So far, my watching-scores are the following:


The Godfather part I:  9 times

The Godfather part II: 7 times

The Godfather part III: 4 times the weakest part in the saga (IMHO)

[The Godfather saga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Godfather_Saga): 0 times I haven't yet found it :(

I also try to make offers but my offers are always and sistematically
refused :)

I have to work in improving my Italo-American pronunciation so maybe I get better results.
