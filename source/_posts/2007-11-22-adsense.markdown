OK, I'm using some Google tools and I find them very useful, but Google closed my Adsense account unexpectedly.  

Before opening my adsense account - or rather my closed account - I have read a lot of forums, thereby gathering a lot information, in order to avoid being banned.  

I'm sure that I have not clicked on my ads.






I think the problem was that the pageviews of my gallery changed from 300pv/day to 10000pv/day. A friend of mine has posted some pictures of my gallery on facebook.  

Consequently, I think Google has reckoned that my clicks were only coming from friends of mine.

I have of course protested. But the answer was that they are considering me too dangerous for their interests. Funny I'm a dangerous person. Coooollll. :)
