title: The Past Our Enemy

I have already spoken about living in the present and about stop thinking.  Unfortunately, sometimes to put theory into practice is more than difficult.

I have followed this philosophy for a while and it is definitely a worthwhile experience - but there is a BUT.

Even though I try constantly to follow this path, my personal past comes in and destroys everything that I have achieved so far - and then I have to start all over again.

The past is our enemy that lies in ambush waiting to come back.

It is incredible how the perspective of reality changes once we wear the glasses of the past.

I do not know whether I can ever really trust someone completely due to my past (including also my mistakes).

I must get my head around in order to get rid of it - but how?
