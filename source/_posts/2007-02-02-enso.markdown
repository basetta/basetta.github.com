Enso is a new idea in computing that brings true universality to interfaces.   
It makes Windows, and everything in it, more humane. It breaks down the walls between applications.   
What does that mean?   
See for yourself: Watch the trailer for a sneak preview of some of Enso's features. You can find the trailer [here](http://www.humanized.com/movies/trailer.php)
