Sometimes I am wondering how easy it would be escape leaving no trace. A lot of people I know do not have a single clue where to find me if I am not using my mobile, email, facebook and so on anymore.

In order to disapear i jotted down a todolist:




  * stop using mobile phone


  * stop using Credit Card and so on


  * change addresse


  * change work


  * try to delete all the personal information online available


  * find a fake document :) in order to take an airplane under a fake name.



That's it. Simple, isn't it ? Only to find a fake document could be problematic :)
