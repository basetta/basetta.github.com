> **Cold cathodes** are the new kid of the light bulb world. Until recently, cold cathodes lights were only available for recess lighting. But what is a cold cathode? In most fluorescent bulbs, a cathode is heated to produce light, but with cold cathodes the cathode operates at the ambient room temperature. The bulbs offer several advantages: they have a very long lamp life, they're dimmable, and they can used in situations where the bulb is turned off and on frequently (even in flashing signs). The non-profit Energy Federation Incorporated, offers cold cathode bulbs that are rated at 5 watts, making them suitable replacement for 20-25 watt incandescent bulbs. They are "wet rated", meaning they can be exposed to the elements, and they are able to be used on a dimming circuit.
