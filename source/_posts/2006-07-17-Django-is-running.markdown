Finally, my new [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com) website is running.
First of all, I have to thank a lot of people from whom I took some
pieces of code.
So, thanks to [http://socialistsoftware.com/](http://socialistsoftware.com/) ,[http://www.wamber.net/](http://www.wamber.net/) and
for the design to [ Aaron ](http://aaron.ganschow.us/).


I haven't corrected all the errors but you know I'm lazy ....one of the
most lazy ones.



Right now I'm working on a small application in order to keep a record of my books.
