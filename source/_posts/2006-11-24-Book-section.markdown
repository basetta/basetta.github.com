Added a new section - the [book section.](/books)
I'd like to put there:   
(1) what I'm reading now,
  
(2) what I read in the past and my comments on them, and
  
(3) my book wish list.





It's only a prototype. I still have to enhance a lot of aspects but I
haven't yet discovered all [django](http://www.djangoproject.com) potentials. In particular, I have to
play a little bit more with the views and the templates.
