title: First Post With Magneto
---

I have simply fallen in love with [Magneto](https://github.com/donmelton/magneto) wrote by [Don Melton](http://http://donmelton.com/).

The minimal approach of Magneto makes me to switch from [Octopress](/2012/02/04/back-online/).

> Magneto is not "blog aware" like some other systems, but it allows you to write a site controller script and plugins which can easily generate blog posts, an index page and a RSS feed. This is how I use it. There may be more work up front compared to other tools, but Magneto gives you very precise control over its behavior and output. 

For converting the Octopress posts to a Magneto compatible format I used the following script

<script src="https://gist.github.com/basetta/11eedb5aec84e0db7ac3.js"></script>

The rendering using magneto is amazingly fast.
