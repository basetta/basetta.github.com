Sometimes one happens to think which sense has life. Sometimes people decide to die out of fear to live.

Sometimes the problems look like insurmountable. You wanna escape from a situation and you are looking for a shortcut.

I think a suicide is really a egoistic act. Sure, you leave back all your problems but for the people who love you it won't be that easy.

There are some websites which contemplate and give suggestion for those facing the ultimate decision.

They are really dangerous and they give weak people the last push.

I don't know what I want to say with this post.

I wanna escape but I don't know how.

Suggestions ?
