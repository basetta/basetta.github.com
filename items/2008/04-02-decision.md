I can't *make up my mind* whether to fight or not to fight.

I think sometimes it is better to take a decision then staying in the middle.

The difficulty is to accept the decisions you take. I explain myself a little bit better.
If I decide to fight I know that maybe I don't get the result I would like to have. This has to be accepted.
Being conscious permits us to accept everything that shows up in our life.
Even though we don't get what we want we should accept that.

I don't speak about resignation but about acceptance.

There is a big difference between the two.

I must get around to take a decision as soon as possible.


PS: I added new [pictures](http://basetta.pupazzo.org/gallery/v/20080329Isabellebirthdayparty/)! Honestly, so far there is only one picture but the others are popping up very soon.
