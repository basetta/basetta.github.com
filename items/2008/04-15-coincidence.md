*Coincidence* is the noteworthy alignment of two or more events or circumstances without obvious causal connection. The word is derived from the Latin /co-/ ("in", "with", "together") and /incidere/ ("to fall on").

Last Saturday something strange happened which makes me believe that coincidences are a merely illusion.

Everything happens for a reason. I don't believe that everything is already predetermined, rather I tend to think that we attract what is going to happen in our life. Saturday proved this to me.

It is unbelievable strange.
