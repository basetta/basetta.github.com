title: How to contact me
---
The best way to reach me online is via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/donmelton) or [App.net](https://alpha.app.net/donmelton). Mention me on one of those services and I notice it quickly. At least, as long as I'm awake and not engaged elsewhere.

[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/donmelton) works too if you're already a "friend." And, no, I'm not trying to grow that number there.

Please, only use email as a last resort. I won't expose my address here, but you can send a message to "me" at this domain. Wink wink, nudge nudge.

If none of those things appeal to you, just shout. I'm hard of hearing but that seems to work for my wife.
