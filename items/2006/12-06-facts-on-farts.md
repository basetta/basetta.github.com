I find this [website](http://www.smellypoop.com/farts.html) really interesting - particularly for my personal culture but not only for mine.  

I quote here some of the funniest (IHMO) FAQs.  


  

**Do men fart more than women?**
      



> No, women fart just as much as men. It's just that most men take more pride in it than most women. There is a large variation among individuals in the amount of fart gas produced per day, but the variation does not correlate with gender.
    I have read that men fart more often than women. If this is true, then women must be saving it up and expelling more gas per fart than men do. 



**At what time of day is a gentleman most likely to fart?**


> 
  

    A gentleman is mostly likely to fart first thing in the morning, while in the bathroom. This is known as "morning thunder," and if the gentleman gets good resonance, it can be heard throughout the household.




**Is it really possible to ignite farts?**
  



> 
    The answer to that is yes! However, you should be aware that people get injured igniting flatulence. Not only can the flame back up into your colon, but your clothing or other surroundings may catch on fire. A survey done by Fartcloud (the site, alas! is not more) indicates that about a quarter of the people who ignited their farts got burned doing it. Ignition of flatulence is a hazardous practice.
    There have also been cases in which intestinal gases with a higher than normal oxygen content have exploded during surgery when electric cautery was used by the surgeon.
