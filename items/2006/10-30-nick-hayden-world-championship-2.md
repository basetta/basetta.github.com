That's it!!!! Hayden is the new World Champion.

The funny thing is that he thinks he won because he is the best driver.



He won only because the others this year were dogged by bad luck (Valentino, Melandri, Capirossi).



I summarize who won how many times this year:


5 - Valentino Rossi

3 - Loris Capirossi

3 - Melandri

2 - Hayden

2 - Pedrosa

1 - Bayliss

1 - Elias


The two victories of Hayden were:





  * Assen where Loris, Marco and Vale were injured (thanks TO gibernau);

  * Laguna Seca where Valentino Rossi was LEADING when his engine broke.



Don't forget that Hayden has the best bike.

So he won the Medicroty World Championship.

So, Nicky how could you be happy for a victory like that?
