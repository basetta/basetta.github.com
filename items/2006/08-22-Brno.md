This weekend I was in BRNO to watch the MOTOGP.

Fortunately, a friend of mine had two passes for the paddocks, so I
could walk a little bit through them.

It was really amazing! Unfortunately, I didn't get Valtenino Rossi's
autograph but I'm looking forward to the next event.

Maybe I will find other passes.
