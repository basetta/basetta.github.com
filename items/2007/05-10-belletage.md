Yesterday, I have listened to really good music.

In [Luftbad](http://www.luftbad.at/), two bands have performed in two short concerts.
I have really enjoyed the place. The acoustics (at least for me) were better than in [Fluc.](http://basetta.pupazzo.org/blog/2007/apr/19/concert-fluc-vienna/)



The first band was "Die drei Tolz".
