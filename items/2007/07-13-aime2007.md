Yesterday, I got back from Amsterdam where I attended the AIME 2007
conference.
Amsterdam is always an amazing city and not only for the joints :)))))





[Here](http://basetta.pupazzo.org/gallery/v/20070706AIMEAmsterdam/) you can find some pictures and [here](http://basetta.pupazzo.org/gallery/v/2006/20060906Amsterdam/) and [here](http://basetta.pupazzo.org/gallery/v/2003/Settembre-2003-Amsterdam-Bruxelles/) some pictures from previous
visits.




The weather was a little bit crazy: sun and all of sudden storm and
viceversa.
This for 6 days with a break only at Sunday. We took the opportunity
to make a bike tour exploring very well concealed parts of Amsterdam.





If you go a little bit further from the city center you can discover
places that can really wind down.




Or at least it worked for me.





Many thanks to [Kathi](http://ieg.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/~kaiser/), she knows why :)





I have meet also interesting people. And now I have the possibility
to work from Pavia for a while.That sounds great for me.





On the other hand, a lot of memories came up in my mind .......that
made me sad.





**Stop complaining and keep going.**
