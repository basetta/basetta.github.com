Finally, the MotoGP starts again.  


Yesterday, Valentino had the best time in Jerez and won the brand-new
BMW M car.  


The five time MotoGP World Champion took the 2007 BMW M Award at the
MotoGP Official Test with scorching 1'38.394 lap, clocked with just five
minutes to go in the session.  

  

  

This championship is going to be really interesting. I think the battle
will be among four or five pilots and I think in this season Colin
Edwards will be of great help for Valentino winning the title.
